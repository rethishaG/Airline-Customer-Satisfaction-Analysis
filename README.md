# Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents a business intelligence analysis of airline customer satisfaction using Skytrax passenger review data. The project aims to evaluate airline performance, identify consistently high-performing airlines, and analyse key service dimensions that influence overall customer satisfaction. Statistical analysis and data visualisation techniques are applied to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Aim
To analyse airline customer satisfaction and service reliability using Skytrax passenger review data in order to identify consistently high-performing airlines and key drivers of customer satisfaction.

---

## Objectives
- To clean and preprocess airline review data to ensure analytical accuracy and reliability.
- To evaluate airline performance using satisfaction ratings, service variability, and statistically robust measures.
- To identify service dimensions that most strongly influence overall customer satisfaction.
- To present insights using clear and interpretable visualisations.

---

## Dataset
The analysis uses publicly available Skytrax airline passenger review data, containing customer ratings, traveller type information, and service quality dimensions such as seat comfort, staff service, food, and value for money.

---

## Methodology
The project follows a structured analytical approach:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
2. Aggregation of customer ratings at airline and passenger segment levels.
3. Application of statistical techniques including weighted ratings, confidence intervals, correlation analysis, and independent t-tests.
4. Visualisation of results to highlight performance differences and key satisfaction drivers.

---

## Key Analyses
- Airline performance analysis using weighted customer ratings and confidence intervals.
- Passenger segment comparison (e.g. Business vs Leisure travellers).
- Identification of key service quality drivers influencing overall satisfaction.
- Statistical validation of observed differences using hypothesis testing.

---

## Visualisations
The project includes multiple visualisations such as:
- Performance ranking plots with confidence intervals.
- Distribution plots for passenger segment comparison.
- Driver analysis plots highlighting correlations between service dimensions and overall satisfaction.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for interactive dashboards)

---

## Key Insights
The analysis highlights airlines that consistently achieve high customer satisfaction, reveals meaningful differences between passenger segments, and identifies service dimensions that have the strongest influence on overall ratings.

---

## AI Usage Statement
Artificial intelligence tools were used in a supportive capacity to assist with understanding analytical techniques, refining code structure, and improving clarity of written explanations. All data analysis, interpretation, and conclusions are the student’s own work.
